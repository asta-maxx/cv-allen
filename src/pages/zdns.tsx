          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Threat Intelligence Integration</strong>: zDNS utilizes comprehensive threat intelligence feeds to stay ahead of emerging threats. This allows the system to dynamically adapt and respond to new types of attacks, providing a proactive defense mechanism.</li>
            <li><strong>AI/ML Techniques</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>DGA Classification</strong>: One of the standout features of zDNS is its ability to classify Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) using machine learning models. 
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Model Performance</strong>:
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Naive Bayes</strong>: Achieving an impressive accuracy of <strong>99.65%</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>distBERT</strong>: Offering a competitive accuracy of <strong>99.4%</strong>.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>These high accuracy rates signify the robustness of zDNS in detecting and mitigating threats that utilize DGAs to generate malicious domains.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backend Capabilities</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>PCAP Analysis</strong>: zDNS can analyze packet capture (PCAP) files to identify suspicious patterns and behaviors in network traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>Zeek Analysis</strong>: Integration with Zeek (formerly known as Bro), a powerful network analysis framework, enhances zDNS's capability to monitor and log network activity, contributing to threat detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Parsing</strong>: The system effectively parses logs to extract relevant data for analysis, enabling real-time insights into network behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Regex Blocking</strong>: zDNS employs regular expression (regex) blocking to filter out known bad domains, allowing for granular control over DNS queries.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frontend Visualization</strong>:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Grafana</strong>: The frontend is powered by Grafana, which provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and visualizing DNS traffic. This visualization helps security teams quickly identify trends and anomalies in real-time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Unbound Integration</strong>: zDNS seamlessly integrates with Unbound, a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver, to enhance DNS query resolution while maintaining high security standards.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8">
          <h2>AI/ML Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            User&apos;s contribution to the zDNS project focused on the AI/ML components. This included the development of machine learning models capable of classifying DGA traffic. The models were trained using extensive datasets to recognize malicious patterns, significantly improving the accuracy of threat detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the implementation of a <strong>STIX/TAXII server</strong> allows for standardized threat information sharing, enhancing collaboration and responsiveness to threats. This server serves as a centralized hub for threat intelligence, facilitating automated updates and enabling the zDNS system to respond to new threats as they emerge.
